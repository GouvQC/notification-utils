# Documentation for email template

## Email branding

The jinja template can render emails with 1 of 4 different brands. 

![The 4 brands: GOV.UK, GOV.UK and logo, Your logo and Your logo on a
colour](../images/email-branding-types.png)

Email templates for services without an associated logo will use the first brand, GOV.UK, by default.

Each of the other brands require certain attributes for the template to render them successfully.

Note: the term 'government identity' refers to logos from the [government identity system (PDF, 4.2MB)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/362346/hmg_identity_system_guidelines_2012.pdf).
